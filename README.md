# Chat GPT Side Scroller

A hackathon prompt to create a web-based game using chat gpt

## Chat GPT Conversation

---

[Here](https://chat.openai.com/share/1a020d98-bba7-44bb-974e-eab33e100a31) you can find my Chat GPT conversation that I used to build this!

Assets found from [gamedevmarket](https://www.gamedevmarket.net/) and [opengameart](https://opengameart.org/)

## Current State

---

The games goal is to destroy as many boats as you can while dodging rocks. You can destroy a boat by ramming into it and the game ends when you hit a rock. There is currently no point system its just an endless game and you restart the game by pressing space.

Things to do still:

- Make object spawning more random and increase speed as game continues

Weird things i've noticed:

- For some reason my hitbox around the orca is huge at points so you'll run into the rock way before you think you should

## How to run/access
